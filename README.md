## More about project

Project contains Home page, page with all Posts, page with post details, Contact

Project has been developed while taking Next JS
[course from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### Main focus

The main idea of this training project is learn how to implement API routes in
Next JS, how to connect and make request to database (mongo DB).

The second idea is learn how to deal with Image and meta data in Next JS. All
about `<Image />` props, `_app.js`, `_document.js` files and `<Head />` element
with html meta tags.

In order to achive main focus I implemented contact form in Contact page.
Submitting form to make request to the server and database (with valid data) and
client get response from server. The status of message (pending, success or
error) client may see via notification component at the bottom of page.

Actually, Notification component made by React context and portal.
